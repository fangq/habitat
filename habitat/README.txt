== # What is Habitat ==

Habitat is a light-weight, fast, easy-to-install and highly customizable
wiki engine. With Habitat, you can set up a user-editable website 
in just a few minutes. Once it's up and running, your Habitat-based website 
can be accessed from anywhere by a web browser, allowing you and
your collaborators to jointly create, edit and manage web pages
using a rich-format wiki syntax. Habitat is ideal small-sized 
projects, though, it has been used for large-scaled open-source 
communities involving thousands of contributors.

Habitat is highly versetile, featuring a Wikipedia-like text 
formatting language, hierachical page structure, excellent 
content reusability, plug-in interface for easy extensions, and much more. 
Being a wiki, Habitat provides a dynamic website that users 
can add new content or edit existing pages over time. It is 
particularly useful when multiple users jointly develop 
documentations or resources in a collaborative project.

Habitat was derived from [http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl UseModWiki]
by [http://nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/~fangq/ Qianqian Fang],
who had also founded the collaborative font development project -
[http://wenq.org/en/ WenQuanYi]. Habitat is a result of over a decade
continuous improvement of the WenQuanYi Wiki.
See [http://wenq.org/habitat/index.cgi?WhatsNew What's New] for
a full list of the new features.

== # How to use Habitat ==

If you run Habitat for the first time, you need to click on the
"[http:?action=newlogin Register]" link on the left to create a username/password
for yourself. You can also apply the admin password you set
during the initial setup. Otherwise, you will be considered as an 
anonymous user and Habitat will only display your IP address.

If you want to set yourself as the only user who can make changes, 
you have to login as an administrator (by setting the admin password
in the register page), and set <tt>EditAllowed</tt> to 0 in the <tt>config</tt>
file. If you want to run Habitat for personal use, this is 
highly recommended.

To create or modify pages, simply click on the "[http:?action=edit&id=Home Edit this page]" 
link on the top. Habitat supports many common Wiki markup
rules used by [http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?TextFormattingRules UseModWiki] 
or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wiki_markup Wikipedia]. Please check out 
[Local:Habitat/Markup Markup Format] and [Local:Habitat/NewSyntax NewSyntax]
pages for more details about formatting.

A new feature of Habitat is the support of hierarchical pages.
You can create something like "[[Page/Subpage]]"
or "[[Page/Subpage/Subsubpage]]" to represent more complex
information or resources.
